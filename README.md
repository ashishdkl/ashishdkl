I am a full-stack developer with experience in both mobile and web application development. I work across frontend and backend systems, including database design and integration.
My primary focus is building reliable, scalable, and user-friendly applications using clean and maintainable code.
I have hands-on experience with Android (Java/XML) and web technologies, and I enjoy working on real-world projects that solve practical problems. I am continuously improving my 
skills in system architecture, APIs, and modern development practices.
